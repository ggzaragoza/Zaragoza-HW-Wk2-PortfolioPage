# Zaragoza-HW-Wk2-PortfolioPage

UPDATED: September 2021

In this repository you will find HTML and CSS files for a portfolio page in development.

The deployed page serves as a prototype for my own personal portfolio site. The CSS employs extensive styling and use of Flexbox to structure as a clean and organized application, and queries serve to reconfigure at breakpoint widths of 1920px, 1536px, 1366px, 1024px, and 828px.

Work is ongoing to build (or emulate) a functioning page that prominently features clients I have worked with thus far as a graphic designer, while also showcasing (as currently deployed) programs and applications developed at this early stage in my web development career. Future updates will include pages with detailed descriptions and galleries for various projects, as this deployed application essentially only functions as a landing page momentarily.
