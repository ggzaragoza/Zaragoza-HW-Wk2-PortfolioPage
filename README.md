# Zaragoza-HW-Wk2-PortfolioPage

In this repository you will find HTML and CSS files for a beginning portfolio page.

The deployed page serves as a prototype for my own personal portfolio site. The CSS employs extensive styling and use of Flexbox to structure as a clean and organized application, and queries serve to reconfigure at breakpoint widths of 1366px, 1024px, and 768px.

To demonstrate functionality, the RESUME link and individual preview boxes in the Work section redirect to the same shared Dropbox link. Link functionality is currently limited to only the text overlay area in each preview box in the Work section.

All photographs and icons were shot and/or edited by me, and any references to organizations and/or clients reflect my own professional career.
